# Chapter 7 Swarm intelligence: particles

## Particle swarm intelligence: bird flocks
* What do the following terms mean for simulating the movement of individual birds in relation to bird flocks?
    - <b>Alignment</b>:
    An individual should steer in the average heading of its neighbors to ensure that the group travels in a similar direction.
    - <b>Cohesion</b>:
    An individual should move toward the average position of its neighbors to maintain the formation of the group.
    - <b>Separation</b>:
    An individual should avoid crowding or colliding with its neighbors to ensure that individuals not collide disrupting the group.

## Particle swarm optimization algorithm
* Discuss the different steps in the particle swarm optimization life cycle algorithm
* Discuss how the position of the particles is updated
* How is the best solution ultimately determined?
* What criteria can be used to stop the algorithm?

## Particle swarm optimization algorithm
* Explain the following relation:
    * New velocity = inertia component + cognitive component + social component
* What is the function of?
    * The inertia component
    * The cognitive component
    * The social component
