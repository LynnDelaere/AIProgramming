# Swarm intelligence 

## Swarm intelligence
* Explain what swarm intelligence is and on what principles is this form of intelligence based.
* Why is the analogy to ants selected in the ant optimization algorithm?

## Ant colony optimization algorithm
* Discuss the different steps in the ant colony optimization algorithm
* Discuss the mathematical formula for destination selection based on pheromones and distance heuristics.
* How is the best solution ultimately determined?
* What criteria can be used to stop the algorithm?

# Ant colony optimization algorithm - selection of the destination
* *Given*: a figure showing the distances between different objects and the intensity of the pheromones on each of the paths.
* *Question*: discuss how the destination with the highest probability is determined. Use the mathematical formula for selecting the destination and choose your own value for alpha and beta.
