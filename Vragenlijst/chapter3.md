# Intelligent search

## Heuristics
* What is a heuristic?
* Why can heuristics improve the efficiency of search algorithms?
* Give a few concrete examples of heuristics.

## A* Search
* Explain how the A* search algorithm works.
* How is the cost function determined?

## A* Search
* *Given*: a search tree
* *Question*: determine the sequence of searching the tree, using the A* search algorithm.

## Min-Max Adversarial Search
* Explain how the Min-Max adversarial search algorithm works.

## Min-Max Adversarial Search
* *Given*: a search tree with the cost of each leaf node
* *Question*: determine the value of each node in the min-max search tree.

## Alpha-Beta Pruning
* Explain how the alpha-beta pruning adversarial search algorithm works.
* What is alpha? What is beta?
* What makes alpha-beta pruning a much more efficient search algorithm?

## Alpha-Beta Pruning
* *Given*: a search tree with the cost of each leaf node
* *Question*: determine the value of each node in the search tree and explain why certain branches in the search tree may be pruned.
