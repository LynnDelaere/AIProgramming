# Search fundamentals

## What is a data structure and give some concrete examples of data structures?

## Explain the following terms: graph, vertex, node and edge.

## *Given*: a graph
* Assignment: determine the 'array of edges', 'incidence matrix' and 'adjacency matrix' of the graph.

## *Explain*: a tree is a connected acyclic graph.

## Explain the following ‘tree’ terms: root node, parent node, sibling node, descendent, ancestor, leaf node, goal node, path, cost, degree and depth.

## Explain the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm and which data structure is used?

## *Given*: a search tree
* Assignment: apply the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find any solution.

## Explain the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and which data structure is used?

## *Given*: a search tree
* Assignment: apply the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find any solution.
