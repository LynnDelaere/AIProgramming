The definition of intelligence is subjective and varies from person to person, from context to context. The definition of artificial intelligence is therefore also subjective.

# What is the difference between quantitative data and qualitative data? Give some concrete examples of both types of data.
    Quantitative data is data that can be measured and expressed numerically. Examples of quantitative data are the number of people in a room, the temperature of a room, the weight of a person, etc. 
    Qualitative data is data that cannot be measured and expressed numerically. Examples of qualitative data are the color of a room, the smell of a room, the taste of a dish, etc.
