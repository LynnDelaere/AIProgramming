# Intuition of artificial intelligence

## Why is there no unanimous definition for artificial intelligence?
 There is no single, simple definition to what intelligence is, and therefore there is no single, simple definition to what artificial intelligence is.  
 The definition of intelligence is subjective and varies from person to person, from context to context. The definition of artificial intelligence is therefore also subjective.

## What is the difference between quantitative data and qualitative data? Give some concrete examples of both types of data.
<b>Quantitative data:</b> Quantitative data is data that can be measured and expressed numerically. Examples of quantitative data are the number of people in a room, the temperature of a room, the weight of a person, etc. <br>
<b>Qualitative data:</b> Qualitative data is data that cannot be measured and expressed numerically. Examples of qualitative data are the color of a room, the smell of a room, the taste of a dish, etc.

## What is the difference between data, information and knowledge?
Data is raw facts and figures that have no meaning.  
Information is data that has been processed and given meaning.  
Knowledge is information that has been understood and can be used to make decisions.

## What is an algorithm? What is an AI algorithm? What are the components of an algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of instructions that are followed to solve a problem.  
An AI algorithm is an algorithm that is used to solve problems that require intelligence. The algorithm is designed to mimic human intelligence so it learns from data and improves over time. 
The components of an algorithm are input, output, and a set of instructions that are followed to transform the input into the output.

## Give a few categories of problems that people are trying to solve via (AI) algorithms.
Some categories of problems that people are trying to solve via AI algorithms are image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.

## What is the difference between a local best solution and a global best solution?
<b>Local best solution:</b> A local best solution is a solution that is the best in a certain area of the solution space. <br>
<b>Global best solution:</b> A global best solution is a solution that is the best in the entire solution space.

# What is the difference between super intelligence, general intelligence and narrow intelligence?
<b>Super intelligence:</b> Super intelligence is intelligence that is greater than human intelligence. <br>
<b>General intelligence:</b> General intelligence is intelligence that can be applied to any problem. <br>
<b>Narrow intelligence:</b> Narrow intelligence is intelligence that can be applied to a specific problem.

# What is the relationship between biology-inspired algorithms, machine learning, deep learning and search algorithms?
<b>Biology-inspired algorithms:</b> Biology-inspired algorithms are algorithms that are inspired by biological processes. They are typically a subset of evolutionary computation such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, etc.<br><br>
<b>Machine learning:</b> Machine learning is a type of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data and improve over time. It makes predictions and decisions based on the data it has learned.<br><br>
<b>Deep learning:</b> Deep learning focuses on deep neural networks with many layers. It's capable of learning high-level features and representations from data. The main characteristic of deep learning include multilayered arcihtectures and end-to-end learning.<br><br>
<b>Search algorithms:</b> Search algorithms are algorithms that are used to find a solution to a problem. They are typically used in optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution. <br><br>
The relationship between biology-inspired algorithms, machine learning, deep learning and search algorithms is that they are all types of AI algorithms that are used to solve problems that require intelligence. They are all designed to mimic human intelligence so they learn from data and improve over time.

# Which three types of 'learning' fall under machine learning and concisely explain each type of 'learning'?
There are three types of machine learning: <br>
<b>Supervised learning:</b> Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset and learns to make predictions based on the data it has learned.<br>
<b>Unsupervised learning:</b> Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. The algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset and learns to find patterns and relationships in the data.<br>
<b>Reinforcement learning:</b> Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from feedback. The algorithm is trained on a reward system and learns to make decisions based on the feedback it receives.
