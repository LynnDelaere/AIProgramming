# Evolutionary Algorithms

## Genetic Algorithms: life cycle
* Briefly explain the life cycle of a genetic algorithm.

## Enter diversity
* Genetic algorithms use crossover and mutation as principles to ensure the diversity of the next generations.
    * Explain this principle.
    * Give some examples of crossover and mutation.

## Genetic Algorithm parameters
* Name 5 parameters to configure a genetic algorithm.
* How does each parameter affect the generation of solutions?

## Fitness function
* What is a fitness function within a genetic algorithm?
* Why is the correct choice of the right fitness function crucial for the performance of the algorithm?
